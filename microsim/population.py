class Population:
    """A Population-instance has three main parts:
           1) A set of Person-instances. The state of the Population-instance is essentially the state of all Person-instances (past and present).
           2) The models for predicting the future of these Person-instances in a default way (I explain default in a bit)
           3) Tools for analyzing and reporting the state of the Population-instance.
       people: The set of Person-instances. They are completely independent of each other.
       popModelRepository: a PopulationRepositoryType instance. Holds all rules/models for predicting the future of people.
                           The models included in this instance must create a self-consistent set of models.
                           Currently, this instance needs to have the rules for predicting dynamic risk factors, default treatment, and outcomes.
                           Static risk factors are also included for consistency and uniformity but of course static risk factors are not 
                           a function of time. 
       The Population-instance knows how to predict the future of its people but only in a default way, meaning with a default treatment
       (in order to create the self-consistent set of models). This is done with the advance method of the Population class.
       The advance method includes a treatmentStrategies argument which can be used by classes that utilize a set of Population-instances,
       eg a Trial class. A Trial-instance would then be able to apply diffferent treatmentStrategies to the Population-instances
       by passing a different argument to the Population advance method.
       _wavesCompleted: how many times the Population has predicted the future of its people (-1 is none, 0 is 1 year, 1 is 2 years).
       _people: Pandas Series of the Person-instances.
       _n: population size
       _rng: the random number generator for the Population-instance, used only for Population-level methods as all Person-instances
             have their own rng.
       Each instance will have two attributes for each PopulationRepositoryType item: the repository itself, and a list of the keys.
       For example, self._dynamicRiskFactorsRepository is the attribute that holds the repository with all models for predicting the risk factors
       and self._dynamicRiskFactors is a list that holds all those risk factors.

    Unit of people subject to treatment program over time.

    (WIP) THe basic idea is that this is a generic superclass which will manage a group of
    people. Tangible subclasses will be needed to actually assign assumptions for a given
    population. As it stands, this class doesn't do anything (other than potentially being
    useful for tests), because it isn't tied to tangible risk models. Ultimately it might
    turn into an abstract class...
