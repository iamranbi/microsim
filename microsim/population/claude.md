# Population Package Documentation

This document provides detailed guidance for working with the population layer in MICROSIM.

## Overview

The `population/` package implements the mid-level of the MICROSIM hierarchy:

```
Trial (experimental design)
  ↓ compares
Population (collection of Person objects)
  ↓ created by
PopulationFactory (NHANES / Kaiser / state builders)
  ↓ People managed via
Person (individual agent)
```

A `Population` instance is essentially a Pandas Series of `Person` objects plus a
self-consistent set of prediction models (`PopulationModelRepository`). It knows how to
advance its people through time in a default (usual-care) manner; a `Trial` injects
experimental treatment strategies on top of that default.

The **Person-first principle** applies throughout: meaningful per-person logic lives on
`Person`; `Population` maps or filters over `self._people` and delegates to `Person`
methods. `Population` methods should not re-implement logic that already exists on
`Person`.

## Directory Structure

- `__init__.py`: Package init. Re-exports `Population`, `PopulationFactory`,
  `PopulationModelRepository`, `PopulationRepositoryType`, `StandardizedPopulation`, and
  `InitializationRepository` so callers can do
  `from microsim.population import Population, PopulationFactory`. Internal modules use
  concrete-path imports (e.g. `from microsim.population.population import Population`) to
  avoid import cycles.
- `population.py`: The `Population` class. Stores `self._people` (Pandas Series of
  `Person` objects), `self._modelRepository` (dict keyed by `PopulationRepositoryType`
  values), and `self._waveCompleted`. Contains the simulation engine, outcome queries,
  incidence/prevalence calculations, age/sex standardization, treatment-strategy queries,
  person-year dataframe construction, and console reporting helpers.
- `population_factory.py`: `PopulationFactory` — static-method-only class that builds
  `Population` instances from NHANES data, Kaiser data, or state-level projections.
  Also contains `calibrate_prevalence`, a root-finding utility for matching priorToSim
  prevalence targets.
- `population_model_repository.py`: `PopulationRepositoryType` enum and
  `PopulationModelRepository` class. The enum defines the four repository keys;
  `PopulationModelRepository` wraps them in a single `_repository` dict.
- `initialization_repository.py`: `InitializationRepository` — supplies the initializers
  run once per person at construction time (GCP cognition model and QALY assignment).
- `standardized_population.py`: `StandardizedPopulation` — loads US mortality-table data
  and builds age-group distributions and per-capita weights used for age/sex-standardized
  rate calculations.

## Repository + Factory Pattern

`PopulationModelRepository` aggregates four sub-repositories, each accessed via the
`PopulationRepositoryType` enum:

| Enum member | `.value` string | Sub-repository type |
|---|---|---|
| `PopulationRepositoryType.STATIC_RISK_FACTORS` | `"staticRiskFactors"` | `CohortStaticRiskFactorModelRepository` |
| `PopulationRepositoryType.DYNAMIC_RISK_FACTORS` | `"dynamicRiskFactors"` | `CohortDynamicRiskFactorModelRepository` |
| `PopulationRepositoryType.DEFAULT_TREATMENTS` | `"defaultTreatments"` | `DefaultTreatmentModelRepository` |
| `PopulationRepositoryType.OUTCOMES` | `"outcomes"` | `OutcomeModelRepository` |

`Population.__init__` receives a `PopulationModelRepository` and stores its inner dict
as `self._modelRepository`. Every access to a sub-repository inside `Population` and
`PopulationFactory` uses `PopulationRepositoryType.<MEMBER>.value` as the key — never
a raw string.

`PopulationFactory` is a collection of `@staticmethod` methods. The two primary
population-creation methods are described in the next section. It also exposes lower-level
helpers (`get_nhanes_people`, `get_kaiser_people`) that return a Pandas Series of `Person`
objects without wrapping them in a `Population`.

## PopulationFactory Method Signatures

### NHANES population

```python
@staticmethod
def get_nhanes_population(
    n=None,
    year=None,
    personFilters=None,
    nhanesWeights=False,
    distributions=False,
    customWeights=None,
    riskScaling=None,
    prevalenceRiskScaling=None,
) -> Population:
```

Parameters:
- `n`: number of people to sample (required when `nhanesWeights=True`).
- `year`: NHANES survey year; must be one of `{1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017}`.
- `personFilters`: a `PersonFilter` instance; defaults to an adults-only (age >= 18) filter
  when `None`.
- `nhanesWeights`: if `True`, sample with NHANES survey weights (`WTINT2YR`); requires
  both `n` and `year`.
- `distributions`: if `True`, fit multivariate Gaussians to each categorical stratum of
  NHANES and draw from those distributions rather than using raw NHANES rows.
- `customWeights`: alternative Pandas Series of sampling weights; mutually exclusive with
  `nhanesWeights`.
- `riskScaling`: optional `dict[OutcomeType, float]` applied to per-outcome risk inside
  `OutcomeModelRepository`.
- `prevalenceRiskScaling`: optional `dict[OutcomeType, float]` applied to per-outcome
  priorToSim risk inside `OutcomePrevalenceModelRepository`.

### Kaiser population

```python
@staticmethod
def get_kaiser_population(
    n=1000,
    personFilters=None,
    wmhSpecific=True,
    riskScaling=None,
) -> Population:
```

Parameters:
- `n`: number of people to draw from Kaiser distributions (default 1000).
- `personFilters`: a `PersonFilter` instance; `None` means no filter.
- `wmhSpecific`: if `True`, uses WMH-specific CV outcome models in the
  `OutcomeModelRepository`.
- `riskScaling`: optional `dict[OutcomeType, float]` applied inside
  `OutcomeModelRepository`.

### Generic dispatcher

```python
@staticmethod
def get_population(popType: PopulationType, **kwargs) -> Population:
```

Routes to `get_nhanes_population`, `get_kaiser_population`, or `get_state_population`
based on `popType`. Passes `**kwargs` through to the chosen method unchanged.

### Prevalence calibration

```python
@staticmethod
def calibrate_prevalence(
    scaleOutcomeType,
    targetOutcomeType,
    target,
    scope,
    popType,
    peopleArgs,
    baselineRiskScaling=None,
) -> float:
```

Uses Brent's method in log-space to find the `OutcomePrevalenceModelRepository`
`riskScaling` on `scaleOutcomeType` such that the realized priorToSim prevalence of
`targetOutcomeType` (within `scope`) equals `target`. Returns the float scaling to pass
as `prevalenceRiskScaling={scaleOutcomeType: scaling}` in a subsequent call to
`get_nhanes_population`. Only `PopulationType.NHANES` is supported.

## Simulation Engine — Serial vs Parallel

```python
population.advance(years, treatmentStrategies=None, nWorkers=1)
```

- `nWorkers=1` calls `advance_serial`, which maps `Person.advance(...)` over
  `self._people` in a single thread.
- `nWorkers > 1` calls `advance_parallel`, which splits `self._people` into
  `nWorkers` sub-populations, farms them out to a `multiprocessing.Pool`, and
  re-concatenates the results.

Each `Person` has its own `_rng` (NumPy `default_rng` instance). Because sub-populations
are independent copies with independent RNG state, parallel execution is reproducible
provided the initial RNG seeds are fixed.

`_waveCompleted` tracks how many years the population has been advanced.
Wave numbering starts at -1 before the first advance; after advancing 1 year,
`_waveCompleted == 0`.

## Creating and Advancing a Population (Example)

```python
from microsim.population import Population, PopulationFactory
from microsim.outcomes.outcome import OutcomeType

# Build a 500-person NHANES 1999 population sampled with survey weights
pop = PopulationFactory.get_nhanes_population(
    n=500,
    year=1999,
    nhanesWeights=True,
)

# Advance 5 years (single-threaded)
pop.advance(5)

# Advance 5 years using 4 worker processes
pop.advance(5, nWorkers=4)

# Query outcomes
stroke_count = pop.get_outcome_count(OutcomeType.STROKE)
dementia_incidence = pop.get_outcome_incidence(OutcomeType.DEMENTIA)

# Print a baseline summary
pop.print_baseline_summary()
```

## Population Attributes and Properties

- `_people`: Pandas Series of `Person` objects. The full simulation state lives here.
- `_n`: population size at construction.
- `_waveCompleted`: integer; -1 before any advance, then increments by the `years`
  argument on each `advance` call.
- `_modelRepository`: dict keyed by `PopulationRepositoryType.*.value` strings; populated
  from the `PopulationModelRepository` passed to `__init__`.
- `_staticRiskFactors` (property): list of static risk factor names registered in the
  static-risk-factor sub-repository.
- `_dynamicRiskFactors` (property): list of dynamic risk factor names registered in the
  dynamic-risk-factor sub-repository.
- `_defaultTreatments` (property): list of default treatment names registered in the
  default-treatment sub-repository.

## InitializationRepository

`InitializationRepository.get_initializers()` returns a dict of two one-time
per-person initializers that run during `Person` construction:

- `"_gcp"`: baseline Global Cognitive Performance score via `GCPModel`.
- `"_qalys"`: initial QALY assignment via `QALYAssignmentStrategy`.

These are passed as `imr` to `PersonFactory.get_nhanes_person` and
`PersonFactory.get_kaiser_person`.

## StandardizedPopulation

`StandardizedPopulation(year=2016)` loads the US mortality table from
`data/us.1969_2017.19ages.adjusted.txt` and exposes:

- `ageGroups`: `{gender_value: [[age, ...], ...]}` — age-group membership lists by gender.
- `populationPercents`: `{gender_value: [proportion, ...]}` — share of the total standard
  population in each age group.
- `populationWeightedStandard`: Pandas DataFrame with `age`, `gender`, and `popWeight`
  columns; used for age-standardized NHANES sampling via
  `PopulationFactory.get_nhanes_age_standardized_population`.

`Population.calculate_mean_age_sex_standardized_incidence` uses `StandardizedPopulation`
internally; callers rarely need to instantiate it directly.

## Gotchas

1. **Repository access via enum, not raw strings.** Always use
   `PopulationRepositoryType.OUTCOMES.value` (which equals `"outcomes"`) as the dict
   key, never the bare string `"outcomes"`. This keeps accesses consistent and
   refactoring safe.

2. **Parallel execution copies the model repository.** `get_sub_populations` calls
   `get_pop_model_repository_copy()` for each worker. The copy constructor for
   `PopulationModelRepository` takes `(dynamicRiskFactorRepository, defaultTreatmentRepository,
   outcomeRepository, staticRiskFactorRepository)` in that order.

3. **Per-Person RNG for reproducibility.** Each `Person._rng` is independent; reproducible
   results in parallel mode require fixing the initial person-level RNG seeds before
   calling `advance_parallel`.

4. **`_waveCompleted` vs. Person wave numbering.** `Population._waveCompleted` counts total
   years advanced. Each `Person` also has its own `_waveCompleted`; the two can diverge if
   a person dies partway through (the Person's wave counter stops advancing, but the
   Population's does not).

5. **NHANES year validation.** `get_nhanes_population` raises `RuntimeError` for any year
   not in `{1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017}`.

6. **`nhanesWeights` and `customWeights` are mutually exclusive.** Passing both raises
   `RuntimeError`.

7. **`distributions=True` is slow.** It fits multivariate Gaussians to every NHANES
   categorical stratum, which is computationally expensive. Prefer `distributions=False`
   (default) for most simulations.

8. **Kaiser population attribute set differs from NHANES.** Kaiser includes `afib` and
   `pvd` as categorical variables that NHANES does not; Kaiser omits `education` and
   `alcoholPerWeek`. Code that iterates over population attributes via the
   `nhanes_pop_attributes` / `kaiser_pop_attributes` dicts must use the correct set for
   the population type.

## Integration with the Core Framework

Populations sit between the `Person` layer and the `Trial` layer:

```
Person.advance(years, dynamicRiskFactorRepo, defaultTreatmentRepo,
               outcomeModelRepo, treatmentStrategies)
  ↑ called by
Population.advance_serial / advance_parallel
  ↑ called by
Trial.run()  (once for the control arm, once for the treated arm)
```

`PopulationFactory` is also called directly from `TrialDescription` subclasses
(`NhanesTrialDescription`, `KaiserTrialDescription`) to build the people that populate
trial arms.
