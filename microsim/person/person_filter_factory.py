class PersonFilterFactory:
    '''Factory that builds a PersonFilter, the object used to include/exclude individuals from a Population.

    A PersonFilter holds two collections of named, boolean-returning functions (see PersonFilter):
        filters["df"]     functions applied to a dataframe ROW before any Person object is built
        filters["person"] functions applied to a Person OBJECT after it has been built
    In both cases a person/row is KEPT when the function returns True and DROPPED when it returns False.
    The two levels exist for efficiency: building Person objects costs memory and time, so cheap
    criteria that can be read straight off the source data ("df" filters) are applied first, and only
    criteria that need a fully constructed Person ("person" filters, e.g. anything that runs a risk
    model) are applied afterward.

    How a PersonFilter is consumed
    ------------------------------
    A PersonFilter is not applied by itself; it is passed to a PopulationFactory method as the
    personFilters= argument, which then applies the two levels in order (see
    PopulationFactory.apply_person_filters_on_df / apply_person_filters_on_people):

        pf = PersonFilterFactory.get_person_filter()
        pop = PopulationFactory.get_nhanes_population(n=1000, year=2007, personFilters=pf,
                                                      nhanesWeights=True, distributions=False)

    The same pf can be handed to a trial via the personFilters= argument of the trial description /
    trial factory, where it defines trial eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria).

    The named-filter registry
    --------------------------
    filterMap is a class-level registry that maps a short string key to a (filterType, filterFunction)
    pair, so that pre-defined filters can be requested by name without writing any lambdas. The
    available keys are:

        "adult"                      df     age >= 18
        "lowSBPLimit"                df     SBP > 126
        "lowDBPLimit"                df     DBP > 85
        "highAntiHypertensivesLimit" df     antiHypertensiveCount <= 3
        "highCVLimit"                person one-year CV risk < 0.00477
        "noMCI"                      person no MCI at baseline
        "hasEpilepsy"                person has epilepsy at baseline

    Pass any subset of these keys to get_person_filter_from_list to obtain a PersonFilter holding
    exactly those filters (each is added under its own key as its filter name):

        pf = PersonFilterFactory.get_person_filter_from_list(["lowSBPLimit", "highCVLimit"])

    get_person_filter() is a convenience wrapper that returns the default PersonFilter, holding only
    the "adult" filter.

    Setting up your own PersonFilter
    --------------------------------
    Start from the default adult filter and add your own:

        pf = PersonFilterFactory.get_person_filter()                  # adult (age >= 18) filter only
        pf.add_filter("df", "under80", lambda x: x[DynamicRiskFactorsType.AGE.value] < 80)

    or start empty (pass an empty list) and register every filter yourself:

        pf = PersonFilterFactory.get_person_filter_from_list([])
        pf.add_filter("df", "men", lambda x: x[StaticRiskFactorsType.GENDER.value] == NHANESGender.MALE.value)
        pf.add_filter("person", "noPriorStroke", lambda x: not x.has_stroke_prior_to_simulation())
        pf.rm_filter("df", "men")                                     # remove a filter by name if needed

    Guidance for writing filters
    ----------------------------
    - filterType is "df" or "person"; filterName is any string unique within that level (re-using a
      name overwrites the earlier filter).
    - A "df" filter receives a single dataframe row (a pandas Series) and must return True/False.
      Index it with the source-column key, most conveniently the *.value of a risk-factor or treatment
      enum (e.g. DynamicRiskFactorsType.SBP.value, DefaultTreatmentsType.ANTI_HYPERTENSIVE_COUNT.value).
    - A "person" filter receives a Person object and must return True/False; use it when the criterion
      needs a method or model that only a built Person exposes (e.g. person.has_mci(inSim=False) or a
      risk model from an outcome repository). Pass inSim=False on Person query methods so the filter
      reflects baseline state rather than simulated events.
    - Prefer "df" filters whenever the criterion can be read from the raw data; reserve "person"
      filters for model-based criteria so Person objects are not built for rows that will be rejected.
